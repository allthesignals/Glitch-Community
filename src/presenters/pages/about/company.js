        <Heading tagName="h3">One of the most influential small tech companies ever</Heading>
        <p>We started out as Fog Creek Software, a pioneering independent tech company that has always put people first.</p>
        <p>
          Our team invented Trello, co-created Stack Overflow, and launched many other groundbreaking apps that collectively have made us one of the
          most influential small tech companies ever.

        <Heading tagName="h3">Built for sustainability</Heading>
        <p>
          We care about making Glitch a meaningful platform for the long term. Our company is 20 years old—that’s ancient in internet terms. We’re
          independent, privately held, and transparent and open in our business model and processes.
        </p>
        <p>This matters because we want you to be as invested in our long-term, sustainable success as we are.</p>

        <Heading tagName="h3">Made in NYC, and around the world</Heading>
        <p>We’re proud to be headquartered in New York City, but about half of our employees are remote.</p>
        <p>
          We have a strong remote work culture where all of our meetings are online and apps and tools like Slack and Google Hangouts are the normal
          way we communicate.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <Heading tagName="h3">A considered work environment</Heading>
        <p>We pioneered remote-working and private offices for creative workers over a decade ago.</p>
        <p>Our work environment has been carefully and thoughtfully designed to give each person both private and collaborative workspaces. </p>

        <Heading tagName="h3">Our inclusion efforts aren’t just platitudes</Heading>
        <p>
          Like most tech companies that have been around for two decades, we used to be a really homogenous place. Unlike most tech companies, we
          admit that we screwed up and we’re not making any excuses for it. Instead, we’re making real changes to build a more inclusive culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          It starts from the top—we have a CEO who’s a vocal advocate for underrepresented workers in tech, and we’ve changed everything from our
          recruiting and ally skills training to the way we design our products, all with a goal of ensuring we’re a place that’s welcoming and
          supportive to everyone.

        <Heading tagName="h3">We are on the inside what we hope to inspire on the outside</Heading>
        <p>It’s impossible to trust a company if you know they don’t practice what they preach.</p>
        <p>
          That’s why we’re committed to zero gaps between our stated and lived values. And that’s also why our values are publicly stated for anyone
