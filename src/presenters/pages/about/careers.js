        </Heading>
        <p>Glitch is where you’ll do your best work. Here are just a few examples of why working at Glitch is different.</p>
        <article>
          <Heading tagName="h3">No endless meetings</Heading>
          <p>
            We don’t have very many meetings, but when we do, they’re well-organized with a specific agenda. Every meeting is remote-first, with each
            person in the meeting joining on video chat—even if they’re based in our NYC HQ. That way, nobody is stuck feeling disconnected or
            forgotten.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each person takes turns keeping notes because we don’t want women or other underrepresented team members to feel unduly obligated to
            handle such tasks, and every meeting with more than 2 people has notes shared to the entire company so that everyone knows what’s going
            on.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <Heading tagName="h3">We respect working hours</Heading>
          <p>
            Our office is usually empty by 6pm or earlier each day, and remote workers leave their home offices on the same schedule, too. At Glitch,
            your coworkers won’t even @mention you in Slack when it’s outside of working hours, and if something is shared during non-work times,
            there’s no expectation that you’ll respond until you’re back at work.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are exceptions for roles where people are on-call or special cases like events or unusual circumstances, but on a day-to-day basis,
            we are enormously productive by letting people live their lives and have their downtime.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <Heading tagName="h3">Almost no email</Heading>
          <p>
            Most people at Glitch get fewer than a dozen email messages in a week from their coworkers. We use email for especially urgent
            company-wide alerts, and to work with people at other companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            For ordinary chat, we prefer to use Slack, and for lengthier conversations, we write out our ideas in full and share them for feedback and
            comment.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <Heading tagName="h3">Internal salary transparency</Heading>
          <p>
            We want you to <i>know </i>you’re being paid fairly. We share salary ranges by role internally so that you never have to worry about other
            folks being paid differently for doing the same work as you.
          </p>
          <p>We respect everyone’s contributions toward our goals regardless of their role. So executive pay is capped at 5X the lowest salary.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <Heading tagName="h3">Comprehensive healthcare</Heading>
          <p>
            From day one, we’ve offered complete health insurance for every employee. We set you up with great health insurance with a really high
            deductible—and then we pay the entire deductible for you.
          </p>
          <p>And of course, we offer unlimited sick days and have generous policies if you need to take care of a sick family member, too.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <Heading tagName="h3">Gratitude is a company value</Heading>
          <p>
            A favorite part of the week is when the whole company takes time out to listen as team members publicly thank each other. Whether it’s a
            brief nod to someone who helped answer a befuddling technical challenge or a broad acknowledgment of a team that worked tirelessly on a
            lengthy project.
          </p>
          <p>This should be corny, but it isn't. The habit of recognizing each other’s efforts leads to a culture of gratitude.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <Heading tagName="h3">We put the important stuff in writing</Heading>
          <p>
            When new issues impacting employees emerge, we don’t just say “trust me, it’ll be okay.” Taking care of employees and protecting workers
            means putting down our commitments to them and their families in writing.
          </p>

          <Heading tagName="h3">Our hiring process isn’t a hazing ritual</Heading>
          <p>
            People are regularly asked to jump through bizarre hoops in job interviews, like undertaking whiteboard coding challenges. We think
            they’re exclusionary and pointless.
          </p>
          <p>Instead, we focus on how real people think, in realistic scenarios they might actually encounter during work.</p>
